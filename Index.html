    <!-- Section: What is Nutrition -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is Nutrition?</h2>
        <p>Nutrition is the process of taking in food and using it for growth, metabolism, and repair. The nutrients in the food we eat give our bodies the energy and materials it needs to function well. Eating a balanced diet with a variety of nutrients helps keep our body and mind strong.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: Macronutrients -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>What are Macronutrients?</h2>
        <p>Macronutrients are nutrients that our bodies need in larger amounts to provide us with energy. There are three main macronutrients:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Carbohydrates</strong> - Our main energy source, found in foods like bread, rice, fruits, and vegetables.</li>
            <li><strong>Proteins</strong> - Help build and repair tissues, found in meat, beans, nuts, and dairy products.</li>
            <li><strong>Fats</strong> - Store energy, help absorb certain vitamins, and support cell growth, found in oils, nuts, and fatty fish.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Macronutrients provide the calories (or energy) that keep us moving and performing daily tasks.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: Micronutrients -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>What are Micronutrients?</h2>
        <p>Micronutrients are nutrients that our bodies need in smaller amounts but are still essential for health. They include vitamins and minerals:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Vitamins</strong> - Organic compounds that support immune function, energy production, and blood clotting. Examples include Vitamin C (found in citrus fruits) and Vitamin D (found in dairy and sunlight exposure).</li>
            <li><strong>Minerals</strong> - Elements that help with bone health, muscle function, and nerve signaling. Examples include calcium (found in dairy) and iron (found in leafy greens and meat).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Though needed in small amounts, micronutrients play big roles in our body's health and development.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: How Nutrients Help Us Function -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>How Nutrients Help Us Function</h2>
        <p>Each nutrient has specific functions that keep our body running smoothly:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Energy</strong> - Carbohydrates and fats provide the fuel we need for physical and mental activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Growth and Repair</strong> - Proteins help build muscles, tissues, and cells, essential for growth and healing.</li>
            <li><strong>Immune Support</strong> - Vitamins like C and D strengthen our immune system, helping us fight infections.</li>
            <li><strong>Bone Health</strong> - Minerals like calcium and phosphorus keep our bones and teeth strong.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Eating a balanced diet with both macronutrients and micronutrients supports overall well-being and prevents deficiencies.</p>
